The current draft of these changes would severely impact nonprofit organizations and faith-based communities in Santa Clara County. Currently, religious non-profits have the most applications pending with the planning department to develop facilities in natural surroundings to serve the local communities. If the proposed facility size is limited by the proposed zoning amendments, nonprofit organizations and faith-based community centers will be unable to expand their community-oriented services, including food relief, youth programs, cultural education, senior support, and spaces for prayer, reflection, and community service that is connected with nature.%0D%0A%0D%0ATo protect the contributions of non-profit and faith-based communities in Santa Clara County, I urge you to:%0D%0A%0D%0A1) Replace the blanket cap with a parcel-size–based approach — e.g., for large parcels, allowing a certain percentage of lot area for development footprint while keeping the majority of land in agricultural, open-space, or hillside use.%0D%0A%0D%0A2) Exclude residential floor area (as currently permitted by zoning and code ordinances) from any non-agricultural development cap. This aligns with the region’s housing shortage and avoids penalizing residential uses such as for homes or caretakers’ quarters.%0D%0A%0D%0A3) Limit Regulations to Designated land - Limit these regulations to land currently zoned for agriculture (A and AR); those are the lands that the County has specifically identified as the properties where agricultural use should be encouraged and protected. Hillside (HS) lands are not particularly productive for agriculture and rural residential (RR) lands are generally too small at 5 acres to support commercial agriculture.%0D%0A%0D%0AThese changes are imperative to protect non-profits and faith-based services in Santa Clara County and to allow these organizations to continue to serve the community.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank you.%0D%0A";
